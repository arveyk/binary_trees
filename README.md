Binary Trees.
These are special types of data structure used for efficient data storage since searches and traveral can be done recurssively

Nodes are dynamically allocated node with pointers to left and right nodes

My team at the moment consists of one person:

There are diffent types of Binary Trees
	Binary search trees
	Perfect tree
	Complete tree
	Full
	


The tree consists of node connected by vertices, nodes with no child/children
being called a leaf node. The top-most node is called the Root node.
